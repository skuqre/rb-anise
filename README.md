# Rebuild Anise

https://skuqre.github.io/rb-anise/

A NIKKE Discord bot that provides you with (almost) everything you need.

This repo will **soon** house the open source version of the bot. Until then, you are free to go to the site and go to the [NIKKE Community Discord](https://discord.gg/nikke/) in order to try her out.

**Q: Why is the bot not public?**<br>
**A**: The bot runs on a low-cost server. Not strong enough to handle a lot of load.

**Q: What are the bot's features?**<br>
**A**: She has a lot, but if you want a summary:
- NIKKE Information, from many different data sources
- Gacha system, with an inventory!
- AI chatbot. Why? I don't know, I thought it'd be funny.
- Stage information without the hassle of looking at a long spreadsheet
- Other miscellaneous data like investment tips, advise answers, all from different data sources

**Q: Why not make it multipurpose?**<br>
**A**: Too much work, and I definitely didn't do that when I made the [old version of this bot](https://github.com/skuqre/anise).
