# Rebuild Anise

https://skuqre.github.io/rb-anise/

A NIKKE Discord bot that provides you with (almost) everything you need.

She's available in the [NIKKE Community Discord](https://discord.gg/nikke/) and the [NIKKE.gg Discord](https://nikke.gg/discord/).

**Q: Why is the bot not public?**<br>
**A**: The bot runs on a low-cost server. Not strong enough to handle a lot of load.

**Q: What are the bot's features?**<br>
**A**: She has a lot, but if you want a summary:
- NIKKE Information, from many different data sources
- Gacha.
    - Includes an inventory!
- AI chatbot. Why? I don't know, I thought it'd be funny.
    - Includes a Privaty and Noah extension!
- Stage Information, including Tower stages!
- Investment tip summaries from different sites
- Advise answers, and advise simulations
- ...and many more!

**Q: Why not make it multipurpose?**<br>
**A**: Too much work, and I definitely didn't do that when I made the [old version of this bot](https://github.com/skuqre/anise).
